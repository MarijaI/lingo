= ToDo list for Lingo

* Update and translate old documentation.
* Raise exceptions with appropriate error classes.
* Allow for handling of documents in various encodings, not just the one the
  dictionaries are encoded in.
* Provide automatic encoding detection.
* Provide automatic language detection (as fine-grained as possible).
* Make lingo run faster!? (benchmark - profile - optimize)
* In-memory (volatile) vs. on-disk (persistent) dictionaries. It should be
  possible to simply use the Lingo API without caring about dictionary storage.
* That being said, provide an easy-to-use Lingo API -- just 'require "lingo"'
  and go for it!
* In addition to that, provide sensible string extensions: String#tokenize,
  String#lemmatize, ...
* Provide a DSL for configuration -- in addition to, or instead of, the current
  YAML format.
* Make sure the Crypter is sufficiently secure.
* Use RSpec for testing.
* Make Lingo capable to use multiple cores or even machines to boost performance
  by connecting Attendees through sockets and use separate processes.

NOTE: New code *should* meet the guidelines outlined in the
RubyStyleGuide[https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide],
existing code will be adjusted along the way.
